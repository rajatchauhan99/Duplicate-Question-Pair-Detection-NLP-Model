"Implemented a Robust Duplicate Question Pairs Detection System Using NLP and Machine Learning"

Developed an advanced system for detecting duplicate question pairs employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. This project centers around a RandomForest classifier, integrating intricate text preprocessing and customized feature engineering. The preprocessing pipeline addresses special characters, decontracts words, and converts specific numbers for comprehensive data cleaning. Custom features include detailed token analysis, encompassing common word and stopword counts, as well as last and first-word matching. Length-based features capture absolute length differences, average token lengths, and substring analysis. Fuzzy matching features, leveraging the fuzzywuzzy library, contribute nuanced insights with QRatio, partial_ratio, token_sort_ratio, and token_set_ratio metrics.

The model's capabilities are showcased through a user-friendly Streamlit web application, enabling real-time predictions based on user-inputted questions. This application seamlessly integrates the trained RandomForest model, loaded via Pickle, and leverages a CountVectorizer for an efficient bag-of-words representation. Meticulous model training and evaluation, emphasizing accuracy metrics, form the backbone of the project's performance assessment. The inclusion of a confusion matrix provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities.

This multifaceted project not only demonstrates proficiency in machine learning but also showcases expertise in natural language processing, feature engineering, and web application development. The meticulous attention to text preprocessing and incorporation of advanced features contribute to the model's robustness in discerning duplicate question pairs.
